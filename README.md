# Luz

> A Spanish language learning app made to help you learn with a spaced repetition learning methodology - built with Node.js, React.js, Redux, MongoDB/Mongoose and Express.

# Features

> Luz is centered around spaced repetition, or the idea of a 'forgetting curve'.  We built a linked list data structure that employs or spaced repetition pattern, so users will receieve the vocab questions they are struggling on more often.
* Receive vocab words specific to your user account
* When questions are answered correctly, cards go to the back of the stack. 
* When answered incorrectly, you'll see that vocab word more often
* Tracks your total accuracy per session
* Tracks your individual word accuracy that persists in the database for each user.
