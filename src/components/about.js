      <p className="about-text">Luz is a Spanish learning app to help you solidify vocabulary words using interactive flashcards and the power of spaced repetition. Spaced repetition is based on the idea of a 'forgetting curve', or that over time our knowledge decays on a subject or that one tricky vocab word.  With Luz, we practice learning Spanish in an efficient manner to retain words for a longer period.</p>
